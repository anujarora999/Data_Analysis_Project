Medical appointment no-shows

This analysis is part of the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program and aims to explore a dataset containing aproximately 100k medical appointments from the Brazilian public health system. It is basically divided into four sections:

(1) Introduction, where the investigation problem is set and the dataset is described; 
(2) Data Wrangling, where the acquired data are cleaned and parsed; 
(3) Exploratory Data Analysis, in which some intuition about the data are built based on the found patterns; 
(4) Conclusion, where the found insights about the problem are reviewed and communicated.
